# PatheticNPCs
A Completely asynchronus packet-base NPC system, with pathfinding based around Pathetic API

This plugin heavily relies on the work from: https://github.com/olijeffers0n/PatheticAPI

All pathfinding and movements of the NPC's are handled with pathfinding from PatheticAPI

# Version support

Support will be added for the most latest version of minecraft, when it stops updating (I are on 1.19.0 at the moment). Once updates for 1.19 stop, i will then upate the NMS
to that latest version

No. No lower version will be supported, screw off, 1.19.x and future versions only. Fork it and add it yourself on a private fork if you want to live in the past.
